# Style Transfer Video Temporal Consistency for Webcam

The following proyect is a merge from Learning Blind Video Temporal Consistency https://github.com/phoenix104104/fast_blind_video_consistency and Universal Style Transfer https://github.com/sunshineatnoon/PytorchWCT. This proyect is the final work from EL7008 Advanced Image Processing from DIE UCH.

For the sake of clarity, I am not the owner of some programs in this repository, being the original authors listed in the previous urls. The work was to select the main functional parts of both algorithms and join them properly in order to use the webcam.

## Requirements
1. gcc 6
2. g++ 6
3. [PyTorch 0.4.0](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/)
4. OpenCV 3.4.4
5. [Cuda 9.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-91-download-archive)
6. [TensorboardX](https://www.google.com)
